This is a repo to hold attack artifacts from my home lab.

1. How did the attacker get the payload onto noabar?
Hint: Look for LOLBINS. 
2. How did the attacker escalate privileges?
Hint: Look for an event that fires when a honey file is accessed. 
3. What was the C2 IP address? 
4. What was the name of the downloaded payload?
5. Were any commands run to perform situational awareness of the environment and if so, what were they?

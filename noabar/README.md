This is a repo to hold attack artifacts from my home lab.
The PowerShell script can be used to parse most event logs, if you do not want to use the parsed json files.
The .ipynb file is an iPython file. You can view it inside of a Jupyter Notebook to get the answers if you are stuck.

1. How did the attacker get the payload onto noabar?
Hint: Look for LOLBINS. 
2. How did the attacker escalate privileges?
Hint: Look for an event that fires when a honey file is accessed. 
3. What was the C2 IP address? 
4. What was the name of the downloaded payload?
5. Were any commands run to perform situational awareness of the environment and if so, what were they?
